## 🚀 Quick Start

### For Developers

1. **Review Contract**
   ```bash
   cat contracts/stake/src/lib.rs
   ```

2. **Understand Interface**
   - Read: [contracts/stake/README.md](contracts/stake/README.md)
   - Time: ~15 minutes

3. **Review Examples**
   - Read: [STAKE_USAGE_EXAMPLES.md](STAKE_USAGE_EXAMPLES.md)
   - Time: ~10 minutes

4. **Review Architecture**
   - Read: [STAKE_ARCHITECTURE.md](STAKE_ARCHITECTURE.md)
   - Time: ~10 minutes

### For Integration

1. **Build Contract**
   ```bash
   cd /workspaces/SkillSync_Contract/contracts
   cargo build -p stake --lib --release
   ```

2. **Run Tests**
   ```bash
   cargo test -p stake --lib
   ```

3. **Deploy**
   ```bash
   # With initial parameters:
   # admin: <governance_address>
   # cooldown_blocks: 600
   ```

### For Operations

1. **Monitor Events**
   - Staked: Mentor deposits
   - UnstakeRequested: Withdrawal initiated
   - Unstaked: Withdrawal completed
   - Slashed: Fraud penalty applied

2. **Manage Admin**
   - Can call slash() for fraud
   - Can transfer admin rights
   - Should be governance contract or multisig

3. **Support Mentors**
   - Explain 600-block cooldown (~1 hour)
   - Clarify slashing policy
   - Provide support for unstaking

---

## 📈 Metrics & Monitoring

### Key Metrics
```
1. Total Staked Value
   - Sum of staked balances
   - Indicator: mentor commitment level

2. Slash Frequency
   - Count(Slashed) / Count(Active mentors)
   - Indicator: fraud rate (target <0.5%)

3. Withdrawal Success Rate
   - Count(Unstaked) / Count(UnstakeRequested)
   - Indicator: user satisfaction (target >95%)

4. Average Stake Duration
   - Time from Staked to Unstaked
   - Indicator: mentor retention
```

### Monitoring Setup
- Event listeners on: Staked, UnstakeRequested, Unstaked, Slashed
- Dashboards showing real-time metrics
- Alerts on unusual patterns (e.g., 3+ slashes per mentor)
- Weekly reports for governance review

## 🎓 Key Concepts

### Stake Lifecycle
```
MENTOR deposits 1000 tokens
  ↓
STAKED state (1000 active, 0 pending)
  ↓
MENTOR requests unstake of 400
  ↓
UNSTAKING state (600 active, 400 pending, unlock at block X)
  ↓
(Time passes, blocks advance to >= X)
  ↓
MENTOR withdraws
  ↓
COMPLETED (600 active, 0 pending, 400 withdrawn)
```

### Fraud Scenario
```
MENTOR fraudulently behaves
  ↓
ADMIN detects and calls slash()
  ↓
Amount deducted from STAKED balance
  ↓
Cannot slash PENDING balance (protected by cooldown)
  ↓
Event logged for governance audit
```

### Cooldown Protection
```
Block 100: request_unstake()
Block 700: unlock_at = block 100 + 600 (cooldown)
Block 699: withdraw_unstaked() → FAILS (not yet)
Block 700: withdraw_unstaked() → SUCCESS
```
